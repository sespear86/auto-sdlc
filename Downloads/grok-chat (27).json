    "content": "Let’s break down the requirement \"Issue #3: Add error handling for invalid inputs\" as a general analysis, assuming it’s part of a software development context (since no specific system or code was provided). I’ll approach this systematically, focusing on what it implies and how it might be addressed.The requirement is asking for a system to gracefully manage situations where the input provided—whether by a user, another system, or a data source—doesn’t meet expected criteria. \"Invalid inputs\" could mean anything from incorrect data types (e.g., a string where a number is expected), out-of-range values (e.g., a negative age), malformed formats (e.g., an invalid email address), or even null/empty inputs where something is required. The goal of error handling here is to prevent crashes, provide meaningful feedback, and maintain system stability.To analyze this:Scope of Inputs: First, you’d need to identify what constitutes an \"input\" in the system. Are we talking about user-entered data in a UI, API payloads, file uploads, or something else? The requirement doesn’t specify, so it likely applies broadly to all input points.Definition of \"Invalid\": This depends on the system’s rules. For example, if it’s a form, invalid might mean missing required fields or failing validation (e.g., a phone number with letters). If it’s an API, it could mean a JSON object missing a mandatory key. Context is key.Error Handling Goals: Typically, this involves catching the error, logging it for debugging, and responding appropriately—maybe with an error message to the user (\"Please enter a valid date\") or a status code in an API (e.g., 400 Bad Request).Implementation Considerations: You’d likely add checks like try-catch blocks (in languages like JavaScript or Python), input validation libraries, or conditional logic to filter bad data before processing. The system should fail gracefully, not catastrophically.Testing Implications: This also suggests adding test cases for invalid inputs to ensure the handling works—e.g., feeding it garbage data and checking the response.Without more details, a practical approach might look like:Identify all input sources in the codebase.Define validation rules for each (e.g., regex for strings, range checks for numbers).Wrap input processing in error-handling logic.Return clear feedback to the caller/user.For example, if this were a Python function expecting an integer:pythondef process_age(age):\n    try:\n        age = int(age)\n        if age < 0 or age > 120:\n            raise ValueError(\"Age must be between 0 and 120\")\n        # Proceed with valid age\n    except ValueError as e:\n        return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"Before this requirement, it might’ve crashed on a string or negative number; now it catches and reports the issue.Does this align with what you had in mind, or did you want me to analyze a specific system or code snippet? Let me know if there’s more context to dig into!"
