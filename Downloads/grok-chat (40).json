    "content": "Let’s break down the requirement \"Issue #3: Add error handling for invalid inputs\" as if it’s a task for a software development project. Since no specific context (like a programming language or system) is provided, I’ll analyze it generically and systematically, focusing on what it implies and how it might be approached.The requirement is asking for a system to manage situations where the input provided—whether by a user, another system, or a data source—doesn’t meet expected standards. \"Invalid inputs\" could mean anything from incorrect data types (e.g., a string where a number is expected), out-of-range values (e.g., a negative age), malformed formats (e.g., an invalid email address), or even null/empty inputs where something is required. The goal of \"error handling\" is to ensure the system doesn’t crash or behave unpredictably when this happens—it should catch the problem, respond gracefully, and ideally inform the user or log the issue for debugging.A typical approach would involve:Identifying Valid Inputs: First, you’d need to define what \"valid\" looks like for each input. For example, if it’s a function expecting an integer between 1 and 100, anything else (letters, decimals, 101, -5) is invalid.Detecting Invalid Cases: Add checks—like conditional statements or validation libraries—to spot when input deviates from the expected. This might be try-catch blocks in languages like Java or Python, or input validation rules in a form.Handling the Error: Decide what to do when an invalid input is found. Options include:Returning an error message to the user (e.g., \"Please enter a number between 1 and 100\").Logging the issue for developers to review later.Providing a default value to keep the system running (though this risks masking problems).Throwing an exception to halt execution if it’s critical.Testing: Verify the handling works by throwing invalid inputs at it—edge cases, garbage data, or missing values—and checking the system’s response.Challenges might include deciding how strict to be (e.g., should \"5.0\" be accepted as the integer 5?), ensuring the error messages are clear to users, and balancing robustness with performance (too many checks could slow things down). The requirement’s vagueness—lacking details on which inputs or what kind of handling—suggests it might need clarification from whoever wrote it. In a real scenario, you’d ask: \"Which inputs are we validating, and what’s the desired behavior on failure?\"In short, this is about making a system more resilient by anticipating and managing bad data proactively. It’s a standard but critical task in coding—without it, you’re one typo away from a crash."
