    "content": "Let’s break down the requirement \"Issue #3: Add error handling for invalid inputs\" as if it’s a task for a software development project. Since no specific context (like a programming language or system) is provided, I’ll analyze it in a general sense, focusing on what it implies and how it might be approached.The requirement is straightforward: it’s asking for a system to gracefully manage situations where the input provided doesn’t meet expected criteria—think wrong data types, out-of-range values, or malformed formats. The goal is likely to prevent crashes, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities, while improving user experience or system reliability.Key points to consider:Scope of \"Invalid Inputs\": What counts as invalid? This could mean anything from a user typing \"abc\" where a number is expected, to a file upload missing required fields, to an API receiving null where it needs a string. Without more context, it’s broad, so the implementation needs to define these boundaries.Error Handling Mechanism: This typically involves detecting the invalid input, stopping it from causing harm (like exceptions or infinite loops), and responding appropriately—maybe logging the issue, throwing an error message, or prompting the user to retry.Where to Apply: Is this for a specific function, a UI, an API endpoint, or the whole system? The requirement doesn’t say, so it might be a catch-all task or tied to a specific feature from prior issues (#1 or #2, perhaps).Success Criteria: The system should keep running without crashing, and the user or calling process should get clear feedback—like \"Error: Please enter a number between 1 and 100.\"A practical approach might look like:Identify Input Points: Find where the system accepts input (e.g., forms, API parameters, file reads).Define Validity: Set rules for what’s valid (e.g., integers only, string length < 50, no special characters).Implement Checks: Add logic to catch violations—think if statements, try-catch blocks, or validation libraries.Handle Errors: Return user-friendly messages (e.g., \"Invalid entry, try again\") or log for devs to debug, depending on the audience.For example, in pseudocode for a function expecting a positive integer:function processInput(value) {\n    if (typeof value !== 'number' || value <= 0) {\n        throw new Error(\"Input must be a positive number\");\n    }\n    // Proceed with valid input\n}\ntry {\n    processInput(\"abc\"); // Invalid case\n} catch (error) {\n    console.log(error.message); // \"Input must be a positive number\"\n}Challenges could include: deciding how strict validation should be, balancing user feedback with system performance, or handling edge cases (like null vs. undefined in some languages). Without more details, the task is open-ended but implies a focus on robustness.Does this align with what you had in mind, or did you want a deeper dive into a specific aspect—like a particular language or system?"
