    "content": "Let’s break down the requirement \"Issue #3: Add error handling for invalid inputs\" as a general analysis, assuming it’s part of a software development context (since no specific system or code was provided). I’ll approach this systematically, focusing on what it implies and how it might be addressed.The requirement is asking for a system to manage situations where the input provided—whether by a user, an API, or another source—doesn’t meet expected criteria. \"Invalid inputs\" could mean anything from incorrect data types (e.g., a string where a number is expected), out-of-range values (e.g., a negative age), malformed formats (e.g., an invalid email address), or even null/empty inputs where something is required. The goal of \"error handling\" is to ensure the system doesn’t crash or behave unpredictably when this happens, and ideally, it should provide feedback or recover gracefully.Key considerations for this requirement:Scope of Inputs: What inputs are we dealing with? Without context, this could apply to a form, a function, an API endpoint, or a command-line interface. The first step would be identifying all input points in the system.Definition of \"Invalid\": This needs clarification. Invalid could mean syntactic errors (e.g., wrong format) or semantic errors (e.g., a date in the future for a birthdate). This depends on the system’s rules or business logic.Handling Mechanism: Error handling could involve:Validation: Checking inputs before processing (e.g., regex for emails, range checks for numbers).Feedback: Informing the user or caller about the issue (e.g., \"Please enter a valid phone number\").Recovery: Defaulting to a safe value, retrying, or skipping the operation if possible.Logging: Recording the error for debugging or monitoring.Impact: Poorly handled invalid inputs might cause crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection if inputs aren’t sanitized).Testing: You’d need test cases for both valid and invalid inputs to verify the handling works.A practical implementation might look like this (in pseudocode, since no language is specified):Check input against expected criteria.If invalid, throw an error or return a message, and avoid further processing.If valid, proceed as normal.For example, if this were a function expecting a positive integer:function processNumber(input) {\n    if (not an integer or input <= 0) {\n        return \"Error: Input must be a positive integer\";\n    }\n    // Process valid input\n    return result;\n}The requirement is straightforward but vague without context. If this is part of a larger system, I’d ask:Which component or function is this for?What specific inputs are expected, and what makes them invalid?How should errors be communicated—UI alerts, logs, exceptions?If you have a specific codebase or scenario in mind, feel free to share it, and I can tailor the analysis further!"
