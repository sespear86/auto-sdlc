    "content": "Let’s break down the requirement \"Issue #3: Add error handling for invalid inputs\" as if it’s a task assigned to a development team. Since no specific context (like a programming language or system) is provided, I’ll analyze it in a general, structured way, focusing on what it implies and how it might be approached.The requirement is straightforward: it’s asking for a system (e.g., a program, function, or application) to gracefully manage situations where the input provided doesn’t meet expected criteria. \"Invalid inputs\" could mean anything from incorrect data types (e.g., a string where a number is expected), out-of-range values (e.g., a negative age), malformed formats (e.g., an invalid email address), or even null/empty inputs where something is required. The goal is to prevent crashes, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities and instead handle these cases in a controlled way.Key elements to consider:Scope of \"inputs\": What inputs are we dealing with? This could apply to user inputs (e.g., from a UI form), API parameters, file data, or command-line arguments. Without context, it’s broad, so the solution needs to identify all input sources.Definition of \"invalid\": What makes an input invalid depends on the system’s rules. For example, a numeric field might reject letters, or a date field might reject \"February 30th.\" This needs to be specified or assumed based on the system’s purpose.Error handling approach: This typically involves detecting the invalid input, preventing it from causing harm (e.g., no crashes or infinite loops), and providing feedback (e.g., an error message to the user or a log entry). Common techniques include try-catch blocks, input validation checks, or default fallbacks.Impact: Good error handling improves reliability, user experience, and potentially security (e.g., blocking injection attacks from malformed inputs).A practical implementation might look like this in pseudocode:Check input against expected criteria (e.g., type, range, format).If invalid, throw or return an error with a clear message (e.g., \"Input must be a positive number\").If valid, proceed with processing.For example, if this were a function to calculate a square root:Input: \"-4\" → Invalid (negative numbers don’t have real square roots) → Return \"Error: Input must be non-negative.\"Input: \"abc\" → Invalid (not a number) → Return \"Error: Input must be numeric.\"Input: \"9\" → Valid → Process and return \"3.\"Challenges to address:Completeness: Have all possible invalid cases been identified?User feedback: Is the error message clear and actionable?Consistency: Is error handling uniform across the system?In summary, this requirement is about making a system robust by anticipating and managing bad inputs. It’s a standard but critical task in software development, requiring clear definitions of \"valid\" and a strategy to handle deviations without breaking the system. If you have a specific context (e.g., a codebase or use case), I can tailor the analysis further!"
