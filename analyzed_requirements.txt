Issue #4: Design a database schema for a blog
Analysis: Let’s break down the requirement "Design a database schema for a blog" (Issue #4) and analyze what it entails. The goal is to create a structured representation of the data needed for a blog system, focusing on the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. Since the requirement doesn’t specify details, I’ll assume a typical blog system and outline a practical schema, explaining the reasoning as we go.
A blog generally involves users (authors), blog posts, categories or tags for organization, and possibly comments. These are the core entities. The schema should support creating, storing, and retrieving this data efficiently while maintaining relationships (e.g., which user wrote which post). Here’s an analysis and a proposed design:
Key Entities and Attributes
Users: Represents authors or anyone who can post or comment.
user_id (Primary Key, e.g., integer or UUID): Unique identifier for each user.
username (e.g., varchar): Display name, unique.
email (e.g., varchar): Contact info, unique.
password_hash (e.g., varchar): Securely stored password.
created_at (e.g., timestamp): When the user joined.
Posts: The blog articles themselves.
post_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each post.
user_id (Foreign Key): Links to the author (references Users).
title (e.g., varchar): Post title.
content (e.g., text): The body of the post.
created_at (e.g., timestamp): When the post was created.
updated_at (e.g., timestamp): When the post was last edited.
status (e.g., enum: draft, published): Tracks if the post is live.
Categories: For organizing posts (e.g., "Tech," "Lifestyle").
category_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
name (e.g., varchar): Category name, unique.
description (e.g., text): Optional details.
Post_Categories: A junction table for many-to-many relationship between posts and categories (since a post can belong to multiple categories).
post_id (Foreign Key): References Posts.
category_id (Foreign Key): References Categories.
Composite Primary Key: (post_id, category_id).
Comments: Reader feedback on posts.
comment_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
post_id (Foreign Key): Links to the post being commented on.
user_id (Foreign Key): Links to the commenter (references Users).
content (e.g., text): The comment text.
created_at (e.g., timestamp): When the comment was made.
Relationships
Users to Posts: One-to-Many. One user can write many posts, but each post has one author (user_id in Posts references Users).
Posts to Categories: Many-to-Many. A post can have multiple categories, and a category can apply to multiple posts (handled via Post_Categories).
Posts to Comments: One-to-Many. One post can have many comments, but each comment belongs to one post (post_id in Comments references Posts).
Users to Comments: One-to-Many. One user can write many comments, but each comment has one author (user_id in Comments references Users).
Proposed Schema (SQL-like)
sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE Posts (
    post_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status ENUM('draft', 'published') DEFAULT 'draft',
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE Categories (
    category_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Post_Categories (
    post_id INT NOT NULL,
    category_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (post_id, category_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES Posts(post_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Categories(category_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE Comments (
    comment_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    post_id INT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES Posts(post_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
Analysis
Scalability: Auto-incrementing integer IDs are efficient for indexing and querying. For a larger system, UUIDs could be considered to avoid collisions in distributed setups.
Integrity: Foreign keys with ON DELETE CASCADE ensure that deleting a user or post removes related data (e.g., comments), preventing orphaned records.
Flexibility: The status field in Posts allows drafts vs. published posts. Categories are optional but extensible via the junction table.
Performance: Indexes are implied on primary and foreign keys. For a high-traffic blog, additional indexes on Posts.created_at or Users.username might be needed for sorting or lookups.
Assumptions and Considerations
Assumes a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) since "schema" typically implies this. A NoSQL approach could work but would need clarification.
No explicit support for tags (vs. categories) or media (e.g., images in posts)—these could be added as separate tables if required.
Basic fields are included; extras like post slugs, view counts, or user roles could be added based on further requirements.
This schema provides a solid foundation for a blog, balancing simplicity with functionality. If you have specific needs (e.g., additional features or constraints), let me know, and I can refine it further!

Issue #5: Implement a caching mechanism for API calls
Analysis: Let’s analyze the requirement "Implement a caching mechanism for API calls" (Issue #5). The goal here is to improve the performance and efficiency of an API by reducing redundant calls to the server or underlying data sources. I’ll break this down into its components, consider the intent, and propose an approach, explaining the reasoning along the way.
Understanding the Requirement
The phrase "caching mechanism for API calls" suggests we need a system to store the results of API requests temporarily so that subsequent identical requests can be served faster without hitting the backend every time. This is a common optimization in web development to reduce latency, lower server load, and improve user experience. Since the requirement doesn’t specify details (e.g., which API, caching strategy, or tools), I’ll assume a typical RESTful API scenario and outline a general yet practical solution.
Key questions to address:
What to cache?: Responses to API calls, likely GET requests since they’re idempotent and fetch data.
Where to cache?: Could be in-memory (server-side), client-side, or at an intermediate layer (e.g., CDN).
How long to cache?: Requires a strategy for expiration or invalidation.
How to implement?: Depends on the tech stack, but I’ll propose a flexible approach.
Analysis of Components
Purpose: 
Reduce latency by serving cached responses for repeated requests.
Decrease server load by avoiding redundant processing or database queries.
Potentially lower costs if external APIs with rate limits or fees are involved.
Scope:
Likely applies to read-heavy endpoints (e.g., fetching blog posts, user profiles).
Write operations (POST, PUT, DELETE) typically bypass caching or require invalidation logic.
Challenges:
Cache Invalidation: Ensuring cached data stays fresh when the source changes.
Cache Keying: Uniquely identifying requests (e.g., based on URL, query params).
Storage Limits: Managing memory or disk usage for the cache.
Proposed Implementation
Let’s assume a server-side API built with a framework like Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, or similar, with a focus on in-memory caching for simplicity and speed. Here’s a breakdown:
1. Choose a Caching Tool
Redis: Popular, fast, in-memory store with built-in expiration (TTL).
In-Memory (Local): Simpler option using a library like node-cache (Node.js) or a dictionary (Python) if the API runs on a single server.
HTTP Caching: Leverage headers like ETag or Cache-Control for client-side or proxy caching.
For this analysis, I’ll use Redis as it’s widely adopted and scalable.
2. Define Cacheable Endpoints
Focus on GET requests, e.g., /api/posts or /api/users/:id. These are likely to benefit from caching if called frequently.
3. Design the Caching Logic
Cache Key: Generate a unique key per request, e.g., GET:/api/posts?category=tech or hash of URL + params.
TTL (Time-to-Live): Set an expiration (e.g., 5 minutes) to balance freshness and performance.
Flow:
Check cache for key.
If found (cache hit), return cached response.
If not (cache miss), fetch from source, cache the result, then return it.
4. Sample Implementation (Pseudo-code)
Using Node.js + Express + Redis as an example:
javascript
const express = require('express');
const redis = require('redis');
const axios = require('axios'); // For external API calls, if applicable

const app = express();
const redisClient = redis.createClient({ url: 'redis://localhost:6379' });
redisClient.connect();

const CACHE_TTL = 300; // 5 minutes in seconds

// Middleware to handle caching
async function cacheMiddleware(req, res, next) {
    const cacheKey = `${req.method}:${req.originalUrl}`;
    try {
        const cachedData = await redisClient.get(cacheKey);
        if (cachedData) {
            return res.json(JSON.parse(cachedData)); // Cache hit
        }
        // Cache miss, proceed to route handler
        res.locals.cacheKey = cacheKey; // Pass key to handler
        next();
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Cache error:', err);
        next(); // Fallback to normal flow
    }
}

// Example API endpoint
app.get('/api/posts', cacheMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Simulate fetching data (e.g., from DB or external API)
        const data = await fetchPostsFromSource();
        const response = { status: 'success', data };

        // Store in cache
        await redisClient.setEx(res.locals.cacheKey, CACHE_TTL, JSON.stringify(response));
        res.json(response);
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Server error' });
    }
});

async function fetchPostsFromSource() {
    // Replace with actual DB query or API call
    return [{ id: 1, title: 'Blog Post 1' }, { id: 2, title: 'Blog Post 2' }];
}

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('API running on port 3000'));
5. Cache Invalidation
Time-Based: TTL (e.g., 5 minutes) auto-expires old data.
Event-Based: Clear cache when data changes (e.g., on POST/PUT to /api/posts):
javascript
app.post('/api/posts', async (req, res) => {
    await savePostToSource(req.body);
    await redisClient.del('GET:/api/posts'); // Invalidate cache
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Post created' });
});
Analysis of the Solution
Performance: Redis provides O(1) lookups, drastically reducing response time for cached calls.
Scalability: Works across multiple servers if Redis is centralized; local in-memory caching wouldn’t.
Trade-offs:
Adds complexity (Redis setup, error handling).
Stale data risk if TTL is too long or invalidation fails.
Flexibility: Can adjust TTL or add conditional caching (e.g., only cache if response is successful).
Assumptions and Considerations
Assumes a server-side API; client-side caching (e.g., via browser or CDN) could complement this.
No specific endpoints or data size mentioned, so I kept it generic.
Redis chosen for its popularity, but simpler options (e.g., in-memory) suffice for small-scale apps.
This approach meets the requirement by implementing a caching mechanism that’s efficient and maintainable. If you have a specific tech stack, API structure, or performance goals, let me know, and I can tailor it further!

Issue #3: Add error handling for invalid inputs
Analysis: Let’s analyze the requirement "Add error handling for invalid inputs" (Issue #3). The goal is to enhance a system—likely a software application, API, or similar—by ensuring it gracefully handles cases where the input provided by users or clients doesn’t meet expected criteria. I’ll break this down, infer the context, and propose a practical approach, explaining the reasoning as we go.
Understanding the Requirement
"Error handling for invalid inputs" implies that the system currently accepts inputs (e.g., user data, API request parameters, form submissions) but may fail, crash, or produce unexpected results when those inputs are incorrect, malformed, or out of bounds. The task is to detect these issues, prevent failures, and provide meaningful feedback. Since the requirement lacks specifics (e.g., what system, what inputs), I’ll assume a common scenario like a RESTful API or a web application and design a general solution that can be adapted.
Key questions to address:
What are "invalid inputs"?: Could be missing data, wrong data types, out-of-range values, or malformed formats.
Where to handle errors?: At the input validation layer (e.g., API endpoints, form handlers).
How to respond?: Return clear error messages, likely with appropriate status codes or UI feedback.
Analysis of Components
Purpose:
Prevent crashes or undefined behavior from bad inputs.
Improve user experience with actionable error messages.
Enhance system reliability and security (e.g., block injection attacks).
Scope:
Likely applies to user-facing interfaces (e.g., forms) or API endpoints.
Focus on input validation and error reporting, not downstream logic errors.
Challenges:
Identifying Invalid Inputs: Requires defining "valid" for each input.
Consistency: Error responses should be uniform across the system.
Granularity: Decide how detailed error messages should be (e.g., security vs. usability trade-off).
Proposed Implementation
Let’s assume a RESTful API built with a framework like Node.js/Express as a concrete example, since APIs commonly deal with structured inputs. The approach can be adapted to other contexts (e.g., web forms, CLI apps).
1. Define Validation Rules
For each endpoint, specify what constitutes valid input. Example: a POST request to /api/posts to create a blog post might expect:
title: String, 1-200 characters, required.
content: String, required.
category_id: Integer, optional, must exist in the database.
2. Implement Validation
Use a validation library (e.g., Joi, express-validator) to check inputs before processing. This keeps logic clean and reusable.
3. Handle Errors
Return HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request) with JSON error details for APIs.
Log errors internally if needed, but avoid exposing sensitive info.
4. Sample Implementation (Node.js + Express)
javascript
const express = require('express');
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Validation middleware for POST /api/posts
const validatePost = [
    body('title')
        .trim()
        .isLength({ min: 1, max: 200 })
        .withMessage('Title must be between 1 and 200 characters'),
    body('content')
        .trim()
        .notEmpty()
        .withMessage('Content is required'),
    body('category_id')
        .optional()
        .isInt({ min: 1 })
        .withMessage('Category ID must be a positive integer')
];

// Endpoint with error handling
app.post('/api/posts', validatePost, (req, res) => {
    // Check for validation errors
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
        return res.status(400).json({
            status: 'error',
            errors: errors.array().map(err => ({
                field: err.param,
                message: err.msg
            }))
        });
    }

    // Proceed with valid input
    const { title, content, category_id } = req.body;
    try {
        const newPost = savePostToDatabase({ title, content, category_id });
        res.status(201).json({ status: 'success', data: newPost });
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).json({ status: 'error', message: 'Server error' });
    }
});

// Mock database function
function savePostToDatabase({ title, content, category_id }) {
    return { id: 1, title, content, category_id }; // Simplified
}

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('API running on port 3000'));
Example Requests and Responses
Valid Input:
json
POST /api/posts
{ "title": "My Post", "content": "Hello world" }
Response: 201 { "status": "success", "data": { "id": 1, "title": "My Post", "content": "Hello world" } }
Invalid Input (Missing Content):
json
POST /api/posts
{ "title": "My Post" }
Response: 400 { "status": "error", "errors": [{ "field": "content", "message": "Content is required" }] }
Invalid Input (Bad Category ID):
json
POST /api/posts
{ "title": "My Post", "content": "Hello", "category_id": "abc" }
Response: 400 { "status": "error", "errors": [{ "field": "category_id", "message": "Category ID must be a positive integer" }] }
5. Additional Error Handling
Type Coercion: The library can sanitize inputs (e.g., trim strings), but explicit checks (e.g., isInt) ensure strictness.
Database Validation: If category_id must exist, add a check:
javascript
if (category_id && !await categoryExists(category_id)) {
    return res.status(400).json({ errors: [{ field: 'category_id', message: 'Category does not exist' }] });
}
Analysis of the Solution
Reliability: Validation catches errors early, preventing downstream failures.
User Experience: Clear, field-specific error messages help users correct inputs.
Maintainability: Middleware keeps validation logic separate and reusable.
Security: Sanitizing inputs (e.g., trimming) reduces risks like injection attacks.
Assumptions and Considerations
Assumes an API context; for a UI, errors might render in a form (e.g., "Title is required" below the field).
No specific inputs or system mentioned, so I generalized with a blog post example.
Focused on validation errors (400-level); runtime errors (500-level) are handled minimally here but could be expanded.
This approach fulfills the requirement by adding robust error handling for invalid inputs. If you have a specific system, input types, or error format in mind, let me know, and I can refine it further!

Issue #2: Implement a user login system
Analysis: Let’s analyze the requirement "Implement a user login system" (Issue #2). The objective is to design and integrate a mechanism that allows users to authenticate themselves within a system—likely a web application, API, or similar—ensuring secure access to protected resources. I’ll break this down, infer the context, and propose a practical solution, explaining the reasoning step-by-step.
Understanding the Requirement
"User login system" implies a way for users to prove their identity using credentials (e.g., username/password) and gain access to features or data restricted to authenticated users. Since no specifics are provided (e.g., tech stack, security level), I’ll assume a typical web application or API scenario and design a solution that’s secure, scalable, and aligns with common practices.
Key questions to address:
What’s needed?: User registration (implied, to create accounts), login, and session management.
How to secure it?: Password hashing, secure session handling (e.g., tokens).
Where does it fit?: Likely integrates with a database and UI or API endpoints.
Analysis of Components
Purpose:
Authenticate users to restrict access to authorized individuals.
Protect user data and system resources.
Provide a foundation for personalization or role-based access.
Scope:
Core features: Registration, login, logout.
Likely includes a database to store user credentials.
Session management to track logged-in users.
Challenges:
Security: Password storage, session hijacking, brute-force attacks.
Usability: Simple login flow, error handling for wrong credentials.
Scalability: Handling many users, possibly across multiple sessions.
Proposed Implementation
I’ll assume a RESTful API with Node.js/Express and a database (e.g., PostgreSQL), as it’s a common setup. The system will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management, which is stateless and widely adopted. Here’s the breakdown:
1. Database Schema
From Issue #4 (blog schema), we already have a Users table. We’ll use it:
user_id (PK, integer): Unique identifier.
username (varchar, unique): User’s identifier.
email (varchar, unique): Contact info.
password_hash (varchar): Securely hashed password.
created_at (timestamp): Registration time.
2. Key Features
Registration: Create a user with hashed password.
Login: Verify credentials, issue a JWT.
Protected Routes: Validate JWT for access.
3. Security Measures
Password Hashing: Use bcrypt to store passwords securely.
JWT: Sign tokens with a secret key, set expiration (e.g., 1 hour).
Input Validation: Prevent injection or malformed data.
4. Sample Implementation (Node.js + Express)
javascript
const express = require('express');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key'; // Store in env vars in production
const SALT_ROUNDS = 10;

// Mock database (replace with real DB like PostgreSQL)
const users = []; // { user_id, username, email, password_hash }

// Registration endpoint
app.post('/api/register', [
    body('username').trim().isLength({ min: 3 }).withMessage('Username must be at least 3 characters'),
    body('email').isEmail().withMessage('Invalid email'),
    body('password').isLength({ min: 6 }).withMessage('Password must be at least 6 characters')
], async (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
        return res.status(400).json({ status: 'error', errors: errors.array() });
    }

    const { username, email, password } = req.body;
    if (users.find(u => u.username === username || u.email === email)) {
        return res.status(400).json({ status: 'error', message: 'Username or email already exists' });
    }

    const password_hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);
    const user = { user_id: users.length + 1, username, email, password_hash };
    users.push(user);

    res.status(201).json({ status: 'success', message: 'User registered' });
});

// Login endpoint
app.post('/api/login', [
    body('username').notEmpty().withMessage('Username is required'),
    body('password').notEmpty().withMessage('Password is required')
], async (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
        return res.status(400).json({ status: 'error', errors: errors.array() });
    }

    const { username, password } = req.body;
    const user = users.find(u => u.username === username);
    if (!user || !(await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash))) {
        return res.status(401).json({ status: 'error', message: 'Invalid credentials' });
    }

    const token = jwt.sign({ user_id: user.user_id, username }, SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '1h' });
    res.json({ status: 'success', token });
});

// Middleware to protect routes
function authenticateToken(req, res, next) {
    const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
    const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1]; // Bearer <token>
    if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ status: 'error', message: 'Token required' });

    jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, user) => {
        if (err) return res.status(403).json({ status: 'error', message: 'Invalid token' });
        req.user = user;
        next();
    });
}

// Example protected route
app.get('/api/profile', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
    res.json({ status: 'success', user: req.user });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('API running on port 3000'));
Example Usage
Register:
json
POST /api/register
{ "username": "alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "password": "secure123" }
Response: 201 { "status": "success", "message": "User registered" }
Login:
json
POST /api/login
{ "username": "alice", "password": "secure123" }
Response: 200 { "status": "success", "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI..." }
Access Protected Route:
GET /api/profile
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI...
Response: 200 { "status": "success", "user": { "user_id": 1, "username": "alice" } }
5. Logout (Optional)
Since JWT is stateless, logout is typically client-side (discard token). Server-side logout could use a token blacklist (e.g., in Redis), but that’s optional complexity.
Analysis of the Solution
Security: 
Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (slow, resistant to brute-force).
JWT ensures secure, temporary sessions; expiration limits damage from leaks.
Usability: Simple endpoints, clear error messages (ties into Issue #3).
Scalability: Stateless JWT works across servers; database scales with user growth.
Trade-offs: 
JWT can’t be revoked easily without extra logic (e.g., blacklist).
In-memory users array is for demo; a real DB is needed.
Assumptions and Considerations
Assumes a web/API context; a desktop app might use local storage instead of JWT.
No role-based access specified, but authenticateToken could check roles if added to JWT payload.
Basic error handling included; could expand with rate-limiting or CAPTCHA for security.
This meets the requirement by implementing a functional, secure user login system. If you have a specific framework, database, or additional features (e.g., OAuth), let me know, and I can adjust accordingly!

Issue #1: Create a function to add two numbers
Analysis: Let’s analyze the requirement "Create a function to add two numbers" (Issue #1). This is a straightforward task requesting the implementation of a basic arithmetic operation within a program. I’ll break it down, consider the intent, and propose a solution, explaining the reasoning as we go.
Understanding the Requirement
The phrase "create a function to add two numbers" suggests a need for a reusable piece of code that takes two numerical inputs and returns their sum. Since no additional details are provided (e.g., programming language, input types, or context), I’ll assume a general-purpose function in a commonly used language and address potential edge cases or variations.
Key questions to address:
What kind of numbers?: Integers, floats, or both?
Where will it be used?: Could be standalone, part of a larger system, or an API.
How to handle errors?: Should it validate inputs or assume they’re valid?
Analysis of Components
Purpose:
Perform basic addition: given a and b, return a + b.
Provide a reusable, modular solution.
Scope:
Minimal: just addition, no UI or complex logic.
Likely a building block for broader functionality.
Challenges:
Input Validation: Ensuring inputs are numbers (ties into Issue #3 on error handling).
Precision: Handling floating-point arithmetic if applicable.
Simplicity: Keeping it concise yet robust.
Proposed Implementation
I’ll use JavaScript as a widely understood language, but the concept applies across languages (e.g., Python, Java). I’ll start with a basic version and then enhance it with error handling.
1. Basic Function
javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
Inputs: a and b (assumed numbers).
Output: Their sum.
Usage: addNumbers(3, 5) returns 8.
2. Enhanced Version with Error Handling
To make it robust (and align with Issue #3’s focus on invalid inputs):
javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
    // Check if inputs are numbers
    if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        throw new Error('Both inputs must be numbers');
    }
    // Check for NaN (e.g., from invalid conversions)
    if (isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)) {
        throw new Error('Inputs must be valid numbers');
    }
    return a + b;
}

// Example usage
try {
    console.log(addNumbers(3, 5));      // Output: 8
    console.log(addNumbers(2.5, 1.7));  // Output: 4.2
    console.log(addNumbers("3", 5));    // Throws: "Both inputs must be numbers"
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
}
3. Alternative (API Context)
If this were part of an API (e.g., tying into Issues #2-#5), it might look like this in Node.js/Express:
javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/add', (req, res) => {
    const { a, b } = req.body;
    if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        return res.status(400).json({ status: 'error', message: 'Both inputs must be numbers' });
    }
    const result = a + b;
    res.json({ status: 'success', result });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('API running on port 3000'));
Request: POST /api/add { "a": 3, "b": 5 }
Response: 200 { "status": "success", "result": 8 }
Analysis of the Solution
Correctness: Handles basic addition (3 + 5 = 8, 2.5 + 1.7 = 4.2).
Robustness: Error handling prevents crashes from non-numeric inputs.
Flexibility: Works with integers and floats; could extend to BigInt if needed.
Simplicity: Minimal code, easy to test and maintain.
Assumptions and Considerations
Language: JavaScript chosen for clarity; Python (def add_numbers(a, b): return a + b) or Java (public int addNumbers(int a, int b) { return a + b; }) would be similar.
Input Types: Assumes numbers; strings or other types trigger errors unless explicitly converted.
Context: Standalone function assumed; could integrate with a calculator, API, or UI if specified.
Edge Cases:
Floating-point precision (e.g., 0.1 + 0.2 ≈ 0.30000000000000004) is a language limitation, not addressed here unless required.
Overflow (e.g., adding very large numbers) depends on language (JavaScript uses 64-bit floats, safe up to ~2^53).
Testing Scenarios
addNumbers(3, 5) → 8
addNumbers(-2, 7) → 5
addNumbers(2.5, 1.7) → 4.2
addNumbers("3", 5) → Error
addNumbers(null, 1) → Error
This meets the requirement with a simple, functional solution. If you need a specific language, additional features (e.g., rounding floats), or integration with other issues, let me know, and I’ll refine it!
