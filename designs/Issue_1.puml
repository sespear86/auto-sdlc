Explanation of the PlantUML Code:
Classes:
Calculator: Represents a class containing the addNumbers function. While the analysis uses a standalone function, wrapping it in a class is common in UML to model functionality. It could represent a utility module or a calculator component in a larger system.
Error: Models the error thrown when inputs are invalid, aligning with the enhanced version’s error handling.
Attributes and Methods:
addNumbers(a: Number, b: Number): Number: The method takes two parameters of type Number and returns their sum as a Number. The type is explicitly specified to reflect the validation logic.
Error has a message attribute to represent the error message (e.g., "Both inputs must be numbers").
Relationships:
Calculator "1" -- "0..1" Error": Indicates that the Calculator class may throw an Error (0..1 multiplicity) when the inputs are invalid. If inputs are valid, no error is thrown.
Notes: Provide context for the Calculator’s role and the Error’s purpose, tying back to the analysis.
Notes on the Diagram:
Simplicity: The requirement is basic, so the diagram is intentionally minimal. A standalone function doesn’t naturally fit UML’s class-centric model, but Calculator serves as a logical container.
Error Handling: The Error class reflects the enhanced version’s robustness, aligning with the analysis’s focus on validating inputs (Issue #3 connection).
Generality: No specific language (e.g., JavaScript) is modeled; Number is a generic type that could map to int, float, or double in other languages.
API Context Omitted: The API version (e.g., /api/add) isn’t modeled here, as the core requirement focuses on the function itself. If desired, I can expand the diagram to include an API structure.
You can render this code in a PlantUML tool to visualize the class diagram. If you’d like adjustments (e.g., specific language syntax, API integration, or additional features like precision handling), let me know!
